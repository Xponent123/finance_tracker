Finance Tracker Website
This is my first web dev project.  

I have used reactjs, javasript, html and css for frontend , Python flask for backend and mysql for dbms.  

In this project, users can add expenses and make monthly budgets and view your expenses and budgets in the summary section.  

Future Modifications:  
One can add graphs and linear regression models to predict the monthly total expense of a user and give him insights on his total monthly expense vs budget 
and how can he achieve the budget.
